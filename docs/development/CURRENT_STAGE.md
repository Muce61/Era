```

Stage 0 and Stage 1 remain PASSED with VALID baselines. Stage 2 Plan v1.2 remains APPROVED;
S2-T19 and S2-T01～S2-T09 are PASSED. S2-T10 v1.10 is APPROVED / IN_PROGRESS under
CR-2026-007 and CR-2026-008. Formal Run A
`stage2-g1-full-a-20260716T144233Z-366a541b7956` is PUBLISHED with Quality PASS, 9508/9508
completed work items, zero failed/UNKNOWN work items and 61,776 logical partitions. Its published
logical hash is `8583f220dc880bf5b7e7ace1435ca2285e59b80dd48aa7d15bd2f8cacac60870`; its published physical
hash is `9fe33a4e7fde1ace3281a208c46f7474f66bc5c5a0e538871b273b2f20131578`.

`CR-2026-009` is RESOLVED / IMPLEMENTED / VALIDATED by Muce approval. Its bounded
release/operator corrections remain valid for formal Run A. `CR-2026-010` is APPROVED / IMPLEMENTED /
VALIDATED. Its replacement Authority Bundle froze twice identically and its unique successor Run B
passed preflight.
The failed Authority run
`stage2-g1-v2-authority-20260717T155227Z-b739106b8dca` rejected a legitimate Catalog-authorized
exact-day `archive=YYYY-MM-DD` tail because the V2 resolved-entry contract allowed only monthly
`archive=YYYY-MM`; it remains immutable failed evidence. The replacement Bundle resolves all
4,752 instrument-days, including BTC/ETH exact-day tails for 2026-07-01 through 2026-07-03, and
repeated freeze produced identical receipts without creating its reserved Run B directory. That
Authority and reserved ID are superseded after preflight proved the frozen V2 parser could not
read formal Run A release supplement v1.1. The successor Run B
`stage2-g1-v2-b-20260718T092459Z-85a6a71ab953` is `FAILED_UNPUBLISHED`: its first BTC Foundation
task observed RSS `1,704,640,512` bytes above the frozen `943,718,400` byte process limit. It
completed no task and wrote no staging or published data. `CR-2026-011` row-group streaming,
explicit release and separate Arrow/current-RSS/baseline-relative gates are IMPLEMENTED and
VALIDATED. The approved real-data profiles and all quality gates PASS. The failed Run B remains
terminal; the next permitted actions are its append-only invalidation, a final-code Authority
refreeze and exactly one replacement Run B. Groups 2～4 remain DRAFT and unexecuted.

That replacement Run B `stage2-g1-v2-b-20260718T105814Z-cb5c25abd485` completed all 316 BTC
monthly and 82 BTC packed Foundation checkpoints but failed before Task evidence sealing because
process-lifetime `ru_maxrss` was enforced as a phase-local delta. It remains terminal
`FAILED_UNPUBLISHED` with zero published files. Muce approved
[CR-2026-012](changes/CR-2026-012.md) keeps lifetime peak audit-only and enforces continuously
sampled phase-current RSS instead. Its real 9,504-row-group packing/seal profile and all code
quality gates PASS. The only permitted continuation is append-only invalidation of that terminal
run, a final-code Authority freeze repeated identically and one unique replacement Run B.
